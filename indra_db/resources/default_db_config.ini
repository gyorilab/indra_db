# Here, you may enter addresses to INDRA database instances, headed by section
# titles [<db_name>]. This name is used to refer to access the database within
# the code. Note that databases may also be defined in the environment using
# the format defined in `indra_db.config.DB_STR_FMT`, with a name starting with
# INDRADB<db_name_in_all_caps>

# Tests Databases:
# ----------------
# Any name with 'test' in it (ex: 'test', 'test1', 'local_test', etc.) may be
# used in testing. Each test database will be tried in order, from top to
# bottom, and the first that can successfully establish a session will be used.
#
# You should also make the names sortable by preference, with "earlier" names
# preferred to later names.
